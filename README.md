# Radial_Schrodinger_equation 

The solver of the radial Schrodinger equation (Bound Solver)
Potentials with a finite number of bound states are considered
When solving a discretized problem, a large matrix will arise
The eigenvalues of this matrix are energy. 
The energies of 3 pieces are => 3 negative eigenvalues, the rest are complex with a positive real part.
Only real negative values are displayed
